      "question": "What was a significant advantage of the R-36 missile over the US's Minuteman III?",
      "options": [
        "Faster flight speed",
        "Greater range",
        "Ability to destroy Minuteman III missiles in their silos",
        "Smaller warhead size"
      ],
      "answer": "Ability to destroy Minuteman III missiles in their silos",
      "explanation": "The passage explicitly states the R-36 could destroy Minuteman III missiles before launch."

      "type": "true_false",
      "question": "The R-36 missile's design allowed it to remain in Earth's orbit indefinitely.",
      "answer": "true",
      "explanation": "The passage states the 1966 design allowed for this capability."

      "question": "What does MIRV stand for in the context of ICBMs?",
      "answer": "Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicles",
      "explanation": "This acronym describes the technology enabling a single missile to carry and deploy multiple warheads, each targeting a different location."

      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What key feature differentiated the R-36M from the first R-36 missile?",
      "options": [
        "A larger warhead",
        "A longer range",
        "Multiple reentry vehicles (MIRVs)",
        "Improved accuracy"
      ],
      "answer": "Multiple reentry vehicles (MIRVs)",
      "explanation": "The R-36M's defining characteristic was its ability to deliver multiple warheads to different targets with a single launch, unlike the single warhead of the original R-36."

      "type": "true_false",
      "question": "The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 completely eliminated the threat of nuclear weapons in space.",
      "answer": "false",
      "explanation": "While Article IV prohibited the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit, it didn't eliminate the threat entirely, as evidenced by the continued development and deployment of ICBMs."

      "type": "analysis",
      "question": "Explain how the development of MIRV technology impacted the military doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). Did it strengthen or weaken the concept, and why?",
      "answer": "It strengthened MAD. MIRV increased the destructive power of a single missile launch, significantly raising the stakes of a first strike and making retaliation even more devastating. This heightened the fear of a nuclear exchange resulting in total destruction for both sides.",
      "explanation": "The increased destructive capability of MIRV made the consequences of nuclear war even more catastrophic, reinforcing the deterrent effect of MAD."

    {
      "type": "synthesis",
      "question": "Considering the information provided, propose a hypothetical scenario illustrating the strategic implications of MIRV technology during the Cold War arms race.  Include at least two different actors and their potential responses to the introduction of MIRV-equipped ICBMs.",
      "answer": "A possible scenario: The USSR deploys MIRV-equipped R-36Ms, increasing their potential to overwhelm US defenses.  The US, in response, accelerates its own MIRV development and missile defense programs, leading to an escalating arms race.  Both sides might also engage in diplomatic efforts, seeking arms control agreements to limit the proliferation of MIRV technology to prevent a catastrophic nuclear exchange.",
      "explanation": "This demonstrates an understanding of how MIRV changed the strategic calculus during the Cold War, highlighting the potential for both escalation and arms control initiatives."
