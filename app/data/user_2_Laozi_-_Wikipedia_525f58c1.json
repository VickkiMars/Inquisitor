      "type": "analysis",
      "question": "Analyze the significance of the statement that the Tao Te Ching might be considered a collaboration rather than solely Laozi's work. How does this affect our understanding of the text's authorship and authority?",
      "answer": "The statement that the Tao Te Ching might be a collaboration challenges the traditional view of Laozi as the sole author and suggests a more complex process of creation.  This impacts our understanding of the text's authority, potentially lessening the emphasis on a single individual's genius while highlighting the influence of a community or tradition.",
      "explanation": "This is a higher-order analysis question exploring the implication of collaborative authorship on the traditional understanding of the text's origins and authority."

    {
      "type": "synthesis",
      "question": "Synthesize the information provided to create a concise biography of Laozi, highlighting the key aspects of his life and legacy as presented in the text. Consider the contrast between traditional accounts and modern scholarly interpretations.",
      "answer": "Laozi, meaning 'Old Master,' was a semi-legendary Chinese philosopher traditionally associated with the Tao Te Ching, a foundational text of Taoism.  While traditional accounts depict him as Li Er, a 6th-century BC archivist who met Confucius and wrote the Tao Te Ching before retiring, modern scholarship questions the accuracy of these biographical details, suggesting they may be later inventions.  Despite the uncertainty around his life, Laozi remains a central figure in Chinese culture, considered the founder of Taoism and ancestor of the Tang dynasty, demonstrating a lasting impact on Chinese thought and identity.",
      "explanation": "This question requires the student to integrate multiple pieces of information from the provided text to construct a coherent narrative, demonstrating an understanding of both traditional and modern perspectives on Laozi's life."
