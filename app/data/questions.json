      "question": "Based on the provided snippets, describe the structure and content you would expect to find in a complete SIWES report for Umoren Victor Martin.  Justify your answer by referencing the given text.",
      "answer": "The report would likely include an introduction, problem statement, description of the project idea, details on the tools used, an explanation of any limitations encountered, and a conclusion. This is inferred from the table of contents, which lists these sections.  The introduction would likely contain background information on the SIWES program and the student's experience at Kodehauz Solutions Planet, as indicated in the second snippet.",
      "explanation": "The answer synthesizes information from multiple snippets to construct a plausible structure for the full report."

      "question": "Imagine Umoren's SIWES supervisor at Kodehauz wants to assess the practical application of his skills.  Describe a scenario where the supervisor could evaluate Umoren's ability to solve a real-world problem using the skills learned during his internship.",
      "answer": "The supervisor could present Umoren with a small-scale software development task that mirrors real-world challenges faced by Kodehauz, such as designing a simple database interface or debugging a short code segment.  This allows the supervisor to assess Umoren's problem-solving abilities, coding skills, and ability to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical situation.",
      "explanation": "This outlines a realistic evaluation scenario that directly connects theoretical knowledge to practical application."
