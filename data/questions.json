      "question": "The provided text touches upon several themes, including the development of PTSD, naivete, the perception of malevolence, and the academic treatment of good and evil. Based on the text, synthesize an argument about how a person's worldview might make them more or less vulnerable to psychological distress, and how Western culture and academia contribute to or detract from this vulnerability.",
      "answer": "Answers should integrate concepts from across the provided text, addressing worldview (naivete vs. awareness of malevolence), the influence of Western culture (sheltered, blind to malevolence), and academic discourse (or lack thereof, regarding good and evil). A strong answer will explain how these factors interrelate to either increase or decrease vulnerability to distress, specifically in triggering events.",
      "explanation": "This question requires students to synthesize the various points made in the text into a coherent argument, going beyond mere recall."
