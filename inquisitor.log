CHAPTER 1
IDEA AND PROBLEM STATEMENT

Understanding is more than a simple mental process; it is a profound journey from the passive reception of information to the active discernment of its full meaning. Understanding is the ability to grasp the full meaning of knowledge, it is the tasking endeavour of ‘discernment of meaning’. In its simplified form, there are two stages to understanding.

1. Knowledge Acquisition
2. Knowledge Reinforcement

Knowledge acquisition involves the collecting of information, the acquaintance of the self with new information.  This is the stage of hearing a new fact, reading a definition, or witnessing a phenomenon for the first time.
This makes the self familiar with the subject matter, it is the mental equivalent of answering the question “have you heard of xyz” or “do you have an idea of xyz”, with a “yes”. At this stage, information is held in the mind, but its full implications, applications, connections to other concepts are not yet generalized

Knowledge reinforcement on the other hand is simply learning again. Knowledge reinforcement is what produces understanding. The idea is that within a finite number of iterations of study, the self becomes proximal to the foundational intuition behind the subject, intuition that could not be obtained by simple acquiring the knowledge.

Fundamentally, knowledge acquisition may sometimes be sufficient for simple information, for example; the statement “she is a girl” or “the capital of France is Paris” requires no further expounding, the meaning is obvious, the information is self contained and does not require any further inquisition into the subject matter to be understood at a superficial level. It is a building block, a single piece of a larger puzzle that has yet to be assembled. However, the limitation of this stage becomes apparent when the information is more complex or abstract. Without further engagement, the acquired knowledge is fragile, easily forgotten and lacks the structural integrity to be built upon.
It is here that the second stage, knowledge reinforcement, becomes indispensable. Knowledge reinforcement is not simply reviewing information; it is a process of active engagement and iterative learning that transforms raw data into a deeply held intuition. This stage is what truly produces understanding. Through a number of cycles, a learner moves beyond the surface-level facts and begins to grasp the underlying principles and foundational intuition of a subject.

In another statement however, for example, the geometric principle that “the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides”, acquiring this knowledge spells out a memorization of the statement itself and its formulaic representation, a2 + b2 = c2.. True reinforcement, however, happens and is manifested when the learner applies this theorem to the resolution of a plethora of problems.
With each successive application, new neural pathways are established, enabling the recognition of how the principle remains invariant across diverse scales and spatial orientations. The formula ceases to be a static piece of information and is instead integrated as a dynamic tool, an intuitive fact that can be recalled and applied without conscious effort. This process underscores the axiom that for any subject of substantive import, the acquisition of information is never sufficient; it must be reinforced through deliberate practice and systematic application.
We can therefore conclude that the entire process of knowledge reinforcement is predicated upon a single, essential action: inquiry. A comprehensive understanding of a subject will and can not be achieved through a passive approach rather, it is the direct consequence of an active inquisition into the matter. This principle has antecedents in Socratic philosophy, wherein wisdom was posited to be the product of a sequence of interrogations. 

Inquiry compels the intellect to engage with information, challenging it to surpass surface level memorization in order to seek out causal relationships, underlying premises and logical consequences. This active interrogative process serves to solidify knowledge, embedding it within the pre-existing cognitive framework of the learner. Without this crucial cognitive bridge, knowledge remains fragmented and devoid of context.

This fundamental self-evident truth concerning the learning process has given rise to a contemporary solution for a perennial pedagogical challenge. Therefore, the Inquisitor.

CHAPTER 2
THE IDEA
Inquisitor, a direct technological response to the necessity of a tool capable of facilitating the critical process of knowledge reinforcement through inquiry. By generating a series of probing questions derived from informational sources such as videos and texts, the Inquisitor effectively automates the essential second stage of understanding. The questions it creates can range from simple factual recall to more complex ones that require critical thinking and application. In a world full of so much information, Inquisitor is a great way to make sure you're not just collecting facts, but actually learning and comprehending them.
CHAPTER 2
APPROACH TO THE SOLUTION

Inquisitor’s backend was built using python’s flask library and google’s generative AI SDK for python, while the frontend was built using tailwind css and javascript.
Coding principles such as modularity of the application were implemented due to the sheer size of the solution
CHAPTER 3
CHALLENGES FACED IN BUILDING

The major challenge faced while building Inquisitor was my low level of skill with frontend development. Languages like tailwindcss were easy to pick up on, but the level of JavaScript proficiency required to execute such a project was lacking. Ultimately, I had to receive some tips for 
learning JS from more advanced programmers and only ended up false-learning the language, i.e I only learnt what was necessary for the development of Inquisitor and not the language as a whole.
Other constraints I faced during development include, rate limits due to the use of a free api key and occasional bugs during development.
